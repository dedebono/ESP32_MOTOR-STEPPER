# ESP32 Stepper Motor Control with Joystick and potentiometer

## Overview

This Arduino sketch demonstrates how to control a stepper motor using an ESP32 microcontroller and a joystick. The project is designed to showcase the integration of the ESP32 with a stepper motor and a joystick for precise motor control.

## Features

- Stepper motor control based on input from a joystick.
- Dynamic adjustment of motor speed based on joystick input.
- ESP32 communicates with the joystick and controls the stepper motor accordingly.

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 Development Board
- Potentiometer
- Stepper Motor
- Joystick
- Motor Driver (e.g., A4988 or DRV8825)
- Power Supply for the Stepper Motor
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires

## Circuit Diagram

Include a simple circuit diagram or link to an image of the wiring.

## Getting Started

1. **Setting Up the Hardware:**
   - Connect the stepper motor to the motor driver.
   - Connect the motor driver to the ESP32.
   - Connect the joystick to the ESP32.

2. **Installing Dependencies:**
   - Make sure you have the Arduino IDE installed.
   - Install the ESP32 board support in the Arduino IDE.
   - Install the necessary libraries for the joystick and stepper motor control.

3. **Uploading the Sketch:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Load the provided sketch (`MOTOR_STEPPER_JOYSTICK_POTENTIOMETER.ino
`).
   - Configure the COM port and board type for your ESP32.
   - Upload the sketch to the ESP32.

4. **Testing:**
   - Power up the circuit.
   - Use the joystick to control the stepper motor.
   - User potentiometer for adjust the speed.
   - Observe the motor's movement based on joystick input.
